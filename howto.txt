use "docker-compose up -d" to run the application in detached mode. This will run it within the docker environment and not output to the console.

-open the "docker-compose.yml" file
-under "services", add a new service in the following structure:
everything between <> will have to be replaced by the value of your choice
----
    <service name>:
      container_name: <container name>
      image: <image tag>
      ports:
      - "<external port to listen to>:<internal exposed port>"
----
the container name has to abide by the docker rules (no spaces and only ascii)

====How to add container information====
-open the "docker-compose.override.yml" file
-under services add the service in the following structure:
----
    <service name>:
      *enivronment:
        - <environment variable>
      *volumes:
        - <volume directory>
